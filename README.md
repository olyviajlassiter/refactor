# Module 1: Challenge 1: Refactor Horiseon Code
This week's challenge focused on taking pre-existing code and refactoring it to meet a user's story and acceptance criteria. In this refactored code you will find semantic structure of HTML elements, alt attributes for user accessibility, consolidated CSS properties and selectors, fully functioning links, and comments before major sections of a page. 

<b>The user's story is as follows:</b><br>
AS A marketing agency<br>
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards<br>
SO THAT our site is optimized for search engines<br>

<b>The acceptance criteria is as follows:</b><br>
GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards<br>
WHEN I view the source code<br>
THEN I find semantic HTML elements<br>
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements<br>
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning<br>
WHEN I view the icon and image elements<br>
THEN I find accessible alt attributes<br>
WHEN I view the heading attributes<br>
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order<br>
WHEN I view the title element<br>
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title<br>
